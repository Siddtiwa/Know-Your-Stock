# Know-Your-Stock
Final Year project by Siddhant Tiwari, Manas Mrinal Bhatt and Anuj Shukla
# 📈 Stock Market Prediction and Analysis Platform

A full-stack web application that provides real-time stock insights, historical data analysis, financial metrics, personalized portfolio tracking, and future price predictions using deep learning models like LSTM and GRU. This platform integrates a React frontend, Flask backend, and leverages `yfinance` for live stock data and custom ML models for predictive analytics.
